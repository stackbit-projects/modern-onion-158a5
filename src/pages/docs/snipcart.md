## Snipcart - Shopping Cart Integration
The Website was developed using Snipcart v.3.~

* What is Snipcart?

Snipcart is a Shopping Cart Integration. Snipcart is CSS and JS only. There is no server side, therefor it security and all that fun stuff is taken care of. As long as you don't expose the private keys or log in information. Ofcourse.

* Why did I choose Snipcart?

Developer Friendly. I spent 2 weeks, working on WooCommerce. I got the same progress done on Snipcart in only 3 days. Seriously. Heck, you can get something working out of the box in minutes. It also looks nicer not gonna lie. üòè

* How does Snipcart Work?

Snipcart uses Buttons with special data attributes to determine what product someone is buying. So all initial product information is written in HTML. Once its live, you can deploy the Snipcart Crawler to find all products in the site and you will be able to manage inventory.
